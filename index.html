        <div class="column">
            <p class="box">there's a customer who comes into my work, who all the girls refer to as <em>"the guy who
                    looks
                    like he got struck by lightning".</em> his hair is grey and stands up like someone rubbed a balloon
                on it,
                and he smells like a gas station toilet. i might feel bad for him if he weren't a customer in the place
                that he was, acting the way that he does. i digress. the other day he phones one of the girls from work
                -- the only one who will sit with him.
                she sits with him for hours on end. i honestly don't know how she does it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="column">
            <p class="box"> but she does. she does enough to have given him her phone number
                to arrange future hours of sitting, apparently. anyway, he phoned her and told her he fell in a puddle
                and that she was just going to have to <em>"take him as he was"</em> becuase he didn't have time to go
                home and
                change before seeing her. this seemed both absurd to me - a grown man falling into a puddle so far that
                he'd get soaking wet - and also like a blessing for him. maybe he'd smell better.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="column">
            <p class="box">he got to the club. he looked electrocuted. she sat with him placating him in his deranged
                behavior. he left. she was drunk. same as it ever was. another staff member more forwardly curious than
                the rest of us asked her, "is he normal? or is he actually like, as mentally ill as he looks?" she
                replied back, <span class="insaneMan">"oh no, he's fully insane. today he told me <strong>when he
                        dies he's going to come back
                        as the
                        sun and burn everyone on earth alive."</span></strong></p>
