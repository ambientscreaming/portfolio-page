## Description

_This portfolio page is a little silly, but I had a lot of fun building it. It highlights the skills I've learned in class recently, as well as some that I've been exploring on my own and testing out. I hope it shows you a little more about who I am as a person, and what I can do as a developer!_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Set up to view should be very easy!_
* _Copy this link: https://ambientscreaming.github.io/portfolio-page/_
* _Paste into your browser, and press go!_
* _Presto! You're looking at my portfolio!_
* _No other setup requirements :)_

## Known Bugs

* _When scaling the screen down, before getting to the phone size and stacking vertically, the "github portfolio" section will start to skew to the right at a certain point. It should remain centered. Still working to fix._
